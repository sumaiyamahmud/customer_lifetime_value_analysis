# Customer Lifetime Value Analysis

This README provides an overview of the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis Project, a Python-based data analysis project that aims to extract insights from a dataset and visualize key metrics related to customer lifetime value.

## How to use this repository
This repository has three files:

1. Excel file - This is the dataset that was used to analyse metrics and create visualizations.

2. Python file - This is the .pynb file that contains the codes to do the analysis on the dataset.

3. Read.me - This is the current file that contains instructions to navigate and use this project and results from the analysis of the data including visualizations.


## Installation instructions

Download the Excel file to your local machine using the link provided in the data sources section on this page.
Download a Python IDE to explore the analysis process and visualizations. I used Jupyter Notebooks for my project.
Feel free to adapt the code to your own datasets or use it as a reference for similar projects.
## Data sources
